MIDIGAN

This project is inteded for me to learn about generative models using tensorflow. The goal is to feed examples of midi files to a model in order for it to generate new midi files. I intend to possibly use movie scores for the examples if such data is readily available. Otherwise, well-known large datasets of midi files are readily available for training.
